# Technical Evaluation

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Architecture  
- Implementation based on Clean Architecture  
- Clear separation into layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)  
- Use of DDD patterns for domain modeling  
- Implementation of CQRS for command and query separation  

### 2. Domain  
- Rich modeling with Entities and Value Objects  
- Implementation of business rules in the domain  
- Use of domain events for change tracking  
- Robust validations using FluentValidation  

### 3. Persistence  
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server  
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction  
- Optimized mapping configurations  
- Migration support for database versioning  

### 4. API  
- Well-defined RESTful endpoints  
- Multi-layer input validation  
- Swagger documentation  
- Proper error and exception handling  

### 5. Security  
- JWT authentication implementation  
- Input validation and sanitization  
- Protection against SQL injection  
- Secure event logging  

## Implemented Features  

### 1. Sales Management  
- Complete CRUD for sales  
- Sales item management  
- Automatic discount calculation:  
  - 4+ items: 10% discount  
  - 10-20 items: 20% discount  
- Sales and item cancellation  

### 2. Business Rules  
- Maximum limit of 20 items per product  
- Business validations in the domain  

### 3. Domain Events  
- SaleCreatedEvent  
- SaleCancelledEvent  
- ItemCancelledEvent  
- Event logging for tracking  

### 4. Validations  
- Domain validation  
- API validation  
- Input validation  
- Exception handling  

## Design Decisions  

### 1. Data Modeling  
- Use of denormalization for external references  
- Entity aggregation  
- Value Objects for immutable concepts  
- Optimized relationships  

### 2. Performance  
- Optimized queries with Entity Framework  
- Lazy loading when appropriate  
- Implemented caching where needed  
- Asynchronous operations  

### 3. Scalability  
- Architecture prepared for scaling  
- Containerization with Docker  
- Implemented health checks  
- Structured logging  

### 4. Maintainability  
- Clean and organized code  
- Applied SOLID principles  
- Low coupling  
- High cohesion
